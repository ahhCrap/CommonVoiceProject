* initial train of Tacotron
* see the initial result of waveglow, try inference
* train with one voice only, see the inference
* check how to add parameters into net training (age / sex/ index of voice etc)
* read papers - how to improve training and reduce the loss
* setup flowtron
* train flowtron, see inference
* check for financing options
* write a document for the project
* check other datasets online
* check how to get a professional voice set (how much would it cost)
